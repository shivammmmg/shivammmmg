## 🚀 About Me

I enjoy building **real-world engineering systems** that combine software and hardware.

So far, my work has focused on:
- Embedded & IoT systems
- Control logic and sensor data
- FPGA-based digital design

I’m now gradually moving toward **software + ML**, building strong fundamentals first.
